# MemristorRobustnessToNonIdeality
Code accompanying our manuscript on Enhancing memristor robustness to non-idealities 

1. There are two folders containing the code for training and testing of three different datastes; FMNIST, NMNIST, and DVS128Gesture.
2. It takes quite some time to train the netwokrs, therefore each test folder also includes pretrained models. There are a total of 6 trained model files in each folder; one trained in normal way and the other five with different levels of noise.
3. Please note that testing requires the 'AIHWKIT' installation and this library is only available for linux[1].
